# Biography

Carlos Jaramillo is currently a doctorate student of computer science at the [City University of New York](https://www.gc.cuny.edu) under the supervision of [Dr. Jizhong Xiao](http://www-ee.ccny.cuny.edu/www/web/jxiao/jxiao.html) at the [CCNY Robotics Lab](https://ccny-ros-pkg.github.io/). 
His research interests include computer vision applied to robotic sensing for navigation, mobile autonomous robots and omnidirectional vision sensors. 
He enjoys programming in any language that gets the job done, but his preferences are Python, C and C++. He has participated in various international events, conferences, and competitions. For instance, he lead the Intelligent Ground Vehicle Competition (IGVC) in 2012.
He interned at Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories ([MERL](http://merl.com)) for a year (2016-2017) where was able to collaborate with [Dr. Yuichi Taguchi](http://www.merl.com/people/taguchi) on developing algorithms for SLAM (simultaneous localization and mapping) and 3D reconstruction.
He is planning to graduate from his doctoral program by the beginning of year 2018.
